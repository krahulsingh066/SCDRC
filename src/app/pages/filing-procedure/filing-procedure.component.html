        person who is required to pay any amount in terms of an order of the District Commission, shall be entertained
        by the State Commission unless the Appellant has deposited 50% (Fifty percent) of that amount in the manner as
        may be prescribed.</p>
    <p>The appellant shall submit three copies of the memorandum to the State Commission for official purposes along
        copies for service to the respondent/OP.</p>

        the working days from 10.30 a.m. To 1.30 p.m.</p>
    <p>In the case of appeals also, it is necessary for the person filing the appeal to get an acknowledgement
        indicating the date of filing the appeal, so as to show the Commission that the appeal has been filed within the
        period of limitation in terms of the provisions contained in the Act.</p>
